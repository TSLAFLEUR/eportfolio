				<h1>About Me:</h1>
				<p>Hello, my name is Tyler LaFleur. I was born and raised in San Diego, California where I started to gain an interest in computers. 
					However, I had another calling and decided to join the United States Marine Corps in 2016, where I served as an infantrymen for 5 years. 
					After serving two deployments overseas, I decided to separate from the Marine Corps and moved to Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, 
					where I started to study Computer Science at North Idaho College. I have since then graduated with my Associates Degree and have continued
                    to pursue a Bachelor's degree with University of Idaho.</p>
				<p>Since I started, I have studied multiple computer languages including, but not limited to, C++, C#, C, python, and HTML to name a few. 
					In addition, I also have conversational knowledge of Japanese, which I have been studying since 2018. Also, thanks to my background in the 
					Marine Corps, I am also skilled in being able to not only listen and follow directions from clients, but I am also able to lead 
					teams efforts. This allows me to be able to work effectively with others while being able to communicate efficiently. </p>
				<p>Check out some of the projects that I've worked on, to include a Legend of Zelda inspired action adventure game created with Unity in C#,
                    <a href="https://github.com/MJHabermann/Duck-Quest">Duck Quest</a>, a final fantasy-esque turn-based game
                    <a href="https://github.com/TSLAFLEUR/CS151-SP-2023-Final-Project.git">Final Duck</a> 
                    created in C++, a hangman game styled in Assembly Language, as well as a Shell program created in C.</p>
